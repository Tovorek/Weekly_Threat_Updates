# Vulnerability Details: CVE-2024-8368


**Vulnerability**: SQL Injection  
**Affected System**: Hospital Management System 1.0 by code-projects  
**Severity**: Critical ❗  
**Source**: VulDB  


## Affected Component
- **File**: `index.php`
- **Functionality**: Login


## Description
This critical SQL Injection vulnerability affects the `Login` functionality of the `index.php` file in the **Hospital Management System 1.0**. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to manipulate the `username` parameter, leading to serious risks such as Remote Code Execution (RCE), authentication bypass, privilege escalation, and unauthorized data access.


## Risks
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**
- **Authentication Bypass**
- **Privilege Escalation**
- **Unauthorized Data Access**


## Possible Fixes for CVE-2024-8368


To mitigate this vulnerability, the following repairs are recommended:


### 1. Input Validation / Input Sanitization
Ensure all user inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious SQL code from being executed.


```php
$username = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'username', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
```


*Explanation*: This sanitizes the input by removing potentially harmful characters that could be used for SQL injection.


### 2. Use Prepared Statements
Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to ensure user inputs are treated as data, not executable code.


```php
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username");
$stmt->bindParam(':username', $_POST['username'], PDO::PARAM_STR);
$stmt->execute();
$user = $stmt->fetch();
```


*Explanation*: Prepared statements prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from the input data.


### 3. Stored Procedures
Use stored procedures to encapsulate SQL logic and reduce the attack surface for SQL injection.


```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetUserByUsername(IN inputUsername VARCHAR(255))
BEGIN
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = inputUsername;
END;
```


*Explanation*: Stored procedures add an extra layer of security by controlling the SQL execution environment.


### 4. Error Handling
Ensure that detailed error messages are not exposed to the user, which can provide valuable information to an attacker.


```php
try {
    // Database operation
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    error_log($e->getMessage());
    die("An error occurred. Please try again later.");
}
```


*Explanation*: This approach logs errors internally without revealing sensitive information to the attacker.


### 5. Principle of Least Privilege
Ensure that the database user account used by the application has the minimum privileges necessary to perform its tasks.


*Explanation*: Limiting permissions reduces the potential damage that could be done if the account is compromised.


### 6. Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Deploy a Web Application Firewall to detect and block SQL Injection attempts before they reach the application.


*Explanation*: A WAF can provide an additional layer of defense by filtering out malicious traffic.


### 7. Patching & Security Auditing
Regularly update the application and its components to apply the latest security patches and conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.


*Explanation*: Keeping the software and its dependencies up-to-date helps to protect against known vulnerabilities.
